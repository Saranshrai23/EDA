Loan Default Risk Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Business Problem
When a financial institution processes a loan application, it faces two major risks:

Business Loss – If a creditworthy applicant is wrongly rejected, the company loses potential revenue.
Financial Loss – If a high-risk applicant is wrongly approved, the company may suffer a financial loss due to default.
Loan Application Outcomes:
Approved – The loan is granted.
Cancelled – The applicant cancels the loan before approval.
Refused – The company rejects the loan application.
Unused Offer – The loan is canceled at a later stage.

Objective
Identify key factors that influence loan default using EDA.
Find strong predictors of default to improve loan approval decisions.
Provide business insights to reduce risk while maximizing profitability.

Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies).
Analyzing consumer attributes (e.g., income, employment type, credit history).
Examining loan attributes (e.g., loan amount, interest rate, repayment history).
Visualizing patterns using histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps, etc.
2. Identifying Risk Indicators
Comparing defaulters vs. non-defaulters based on different features.
Finding strong predictors of default using statistical analysis.
3. Business Insights & Recommendations
Suggesting strategies like higher interest rates for risky customers or rejecting applications based on key risk factors.
Providing actionable insights to improve loan approval policies.

Deliverables
EDA Report summarizing key findings.
Visualizations & Statistical Insights to support conclusions.
Recommendations for Risk Assessment in loan approvals.
